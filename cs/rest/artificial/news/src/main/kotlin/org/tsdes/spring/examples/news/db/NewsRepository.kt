/**
 *  Recall CRUD means: Create, Read, Update and Delete.
 *
 *  By using @Repository annotation on an interface that extends  CrudRepository,
 *  Spring will give a bean initialized to do operation on the given Entity
 *  in the database, like save(), exists(), findAll(), etc.
 *  So a lot of free stuff with a single line of code.
 *
 *  Furthermore, instead of creating JPQL queries manually, and methods in a EJB to
 *  call them, here Spring can automatically generate code in the proxied classes based
 *  on the name of the functions.
 *  For example, if you define a method findAllByCountry (which is just a signature in
 *  this interface), Spring analyse the method name and will create a method that does
 *  query on database for all the entities from the given input country.
 *  If you misspell a property, you will get runtime errors.
 *  So it is important to have tests for them (which you should have anyway...)
